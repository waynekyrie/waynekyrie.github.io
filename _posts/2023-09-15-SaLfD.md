This paper presents a simulation-aided learning from demonstration (SaLfD) framework for easily deploying LEGO prototyping capability to robots. 
In particular, the user demonstrates constructing the customized novel LEGO object. 
The robot extracts the task information by observing the human operation and generates the construction plan. 
A simulation is developed to verify the correctness of the learned construction plan and the resulting LEGO prototype.

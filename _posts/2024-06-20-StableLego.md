This paper proposes a new optimization formulation, which optimizes over force-balancing equations, to infer the structural stability of block stacking assembly. 
In addition, we provide StableLego: a comprehensive Lego assembly dataset, which includes a wide variety of Lego assembly designs for real-world objects.
The dataset includes more than 50k Lego structures built using standardized Lego bricks with different dimensions along with their stability inferences generated by the proposed algorithm.

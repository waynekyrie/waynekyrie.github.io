This paper introduces a jerk-based safe set algorithm (JSSA) to ensure collision avoidance while considering the robot dynamics constraints. The JSSA greatly extends the scope of the original safe set algorithm, which has only been applied for second-order systems with unbounded accelerations. The JSSA is implemented on the FANUC LR Mate 200id/7L robot and validated with HRI tasks.

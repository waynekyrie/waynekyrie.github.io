This was a project that I did during the internship in the lab led by [Prof. Xiaorui Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S11Nv9EAAAAJ&hl=en).
The goal for this project was to achieve stable UAV control based on smartphone motion sensing to make the control method intuitive. 
This project was collaborated with [Chris Yin](https://github.com/ChrisYin).

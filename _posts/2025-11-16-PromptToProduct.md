We present <strong>Prompt-to-Product</strong>, a proof-of-concept physical AI system that transforms abstract human imagination into tangible physical creations. 
Users simply describe their ideas in natural language, and Prompt-to-Product interprets those descriptions to generate concrete, physically buildable assembly designs. 
The system then reasons and constructs the final product, brick by brick, bringing imagination seamlessly into reality.

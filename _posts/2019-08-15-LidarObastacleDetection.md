This was an intern project during my internship at Zenuity in the summer of 2019. 
The team was trying to build a mobile robot that can manuever in the office automatically. 
There were many modules to implement, including path planning, motion control, safety, etc. 
I was working on the Lidar perception module. 
The goal was to use the Lidar to detect the obstacles and generate the free area that was traversable for the robot.

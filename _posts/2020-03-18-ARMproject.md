In manufacturing, many large workpieces are made by welding subcomponents together. It is required to remove the weld bead remained on the surface in order to deploy the workpiece in real applications. Conventionally, the weld beads are removed manually by human workers. However, the work is time-consuming, expensive, and more importantly, dangerous for human workers. For instance, a metal tube is manufactured by welding the upper half and the bottom half. The weld bead would remain both inside and outside the tube surface. It is relatively easy for a human to polish the bead on outter surface, but it is extremely difficult and dangerous for a human to polish inside the tube. Therefore, this project provides a robotic solution to the polishing task.

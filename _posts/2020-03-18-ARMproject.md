Conventional weld bead removal is manually performed by human workers, which is time-consuming, expensive, and more importantly, dangerous, especially in a confined environment, such as inside a metal tube.
This project develops a robotic solution for polishing and grinding complex surfaces in a confined workspace to alleviate the cost and manual effort.

This paper presents a jerk-bounded position control driver (JPC) for industrial robots. 
JPC provides a unified interface for tracking complex trajectories and is able to enforce dynamic constraints using motion-level control, without accessing servo-level control. 
Most importantly, JPC enables real-time trajectory modification. Users can overwrite the ongoing task with a new one without violating dynamic constraints.

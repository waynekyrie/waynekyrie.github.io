This paper formulates the combinatorial assembly sequence planning as a reinforcement learning problem.
In particular, this work proposes an optimization-based physics-aware action mask to address the challenges due to the sim-to-real gap and combinatorial nature.
The proposed method effectively guides the assembly policy learning and ensures violation-free deployment by planning physically executable assembly sequences to construct goal objects.

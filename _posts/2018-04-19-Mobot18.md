This was a project for the [CMU Mobot competition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/mobot/race.html) in 2018. This event is an annual competition held by the School of Computer Science. The goal is to build a mobile robot that follows a track in front of Wean Hall. There are small gates representing checkpoints placed along the track, and the robot is required to go through the gates. So the robot should strictly follow the line instead of go directly to the goal point. We got the third place in the end.

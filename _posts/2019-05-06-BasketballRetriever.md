This was the capstone project I did during my undergrad. 
The idea was to build a collaborative mobile robot that helps the basketball player during practice. 
When a player is practicing shooting, the ball would bounce to random places if missed the shot. 
It is sometimes frustrating and time-consuming to get the ball back.
Therefore, in this project we intend to build a mobile robot that can retrieve the ball each time when it bounces away.
We would like to thank [Prof. Tamal Mukherjee](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/mukherjee-tamal.html) for his guidance and support.

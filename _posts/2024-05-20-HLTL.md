This paper formulates a decomposition-based method to address tasks under hierarchical temporal logic structure.
Each specification is first broken down into a range of temporally interrelated sub-tasks. 
We further mine the temporal relations among the sub-tasks of different specifications within the hierarchy. 
Subsequently, a Mixed Integer Linear Program is utilized to generate a spatio-temporal plan for each robot.

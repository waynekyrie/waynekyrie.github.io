This paper investigates safe and efficient robotic LEGO manipulation. 
In particular, this paper reduces the complexity of the manipulation by hardware-software co-design. 
An end-of-arm tool (EOAT) is designed, which reduces the problem dimension and allows large industrial robots to easily manipulate LEGO bricks. 
In addition, this paper uses evolution strategy to safely optimize the robot motion for LEGO manipulation.

This paper studies multi-robot coordination and proposes APEX-MR, an asynchronous planning and execution framework designed to safely and efficiently coordinate multiple robots to achieve dexterous cooperative tasks, e.g., LEGO assembly. 
APEX-MR significantly improves task efficiency, scales to large-scale/long-horizon tasks, is robust against uncertainty/contingencies, and ensures collaboration safety.
We deploy APEX-MR to a bimanual system and present the first robotic system capable of performing customized LEGO assembly using commercial LEGO bricks.
